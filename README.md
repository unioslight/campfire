## Why 'Campfire'?

The name 'Campfire' was chosen by our Lead Front-end Developer, [Richard Lindon](https://github.com/richardlindon).

Campfires are recognised around the world as a place for gathering; for discussion; for reflection; and, for learning. They are where ideas can be shared and advice can be passed on. All are welcome at the campfire, and all are free to participate in the discussion.

We are striving to build this type of open and collaborative community in the Digital Products team at Unios.
