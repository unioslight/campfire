## What we do

The Digital Products team designs, develops and maintains software for Unios. We are a small, geographically distributed team with members working out of our headquarters in Perth, Australia; and our office in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

Founded in August 2020, our team has two primary objectives:

1. to improve the productivity, efficiency and satisfaction of teams and departments at Unios by optimising processes and operations with bespoke software; and,
1. to facilitate competitive advantage by providing consumers with effective and innovative software solutions that address areas-of-difficulty that exist within the lighting industry.

## Our culture and principles

TODO:

### Continuous improvement

TODO:

### Automate wherever possible

TODO:

### Use the best tool for the job

Overzealous devotion to particular platforms and technology stacks can sometimes put developers in the unfortunate position of _banging a square peg into a round hole_. We are cautious of this and broadly adopt the philosophy of "using the best tool for the job".

### DevOps: Developers own _everything_
